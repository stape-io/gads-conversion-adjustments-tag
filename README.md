# Google Ads Conversion Adjustments Tag for Google Tag Manager Server Container

Once a conversion has already been reported to Google Ads, you can adjust the conversion at a later point in time in the Google Ads API.
This tag allows you to make the following changes to a specific Google Ads conversion action:
- Enhance: add first party user identifiers to the conversion, such as: email, phone etc.
- Restate: change the value of the conversion.
- Retract: negate the conversion so that its total value and count are zero.
